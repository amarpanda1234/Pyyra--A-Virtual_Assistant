This Python code is designed to create a virtual assistant named **Pyyra** that can interact with users using voice commands. It leverages libraries like `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech, `speech_recognition` to capture and recognize voice input, `wikipedia` for retrieving information, and `webbrowser` for opening websites.

### Key Features:
1. **Speech Synthesis & Recognition**: 
     -> Pyyra speaks responses using `pyttsx3` and listens for commands via the microphone using `speech_recognition`.
2. **Greeting**: 
     -> Pyyra greets users based on the time of day (morning, afternoon, or evening).
3. **Wikipedia Search**: 
     -> When a command includes "Wikipedia", Pyyra searches for a topic on Wikipedia and reads a brief summary.
4. **Google Search**: 
     -> If the user says "search for", Pyyra opens the default web browser and searches for the given query on Google.
5. **Notepad Launching**: 
     -> Opens Notepad when requested.
6. **Music Playback**: 
     -> Plays music from a specified directory.
7. **Time & Date**: 
     -> Responds to requests for the current time and date.
8. **Program Closure**: 
     -> Pyyra can close the program when the user asks to.

The assistant is designed to be interactive and responsive, with a variety of functionalities that make it a helpful tool for basic tasks.
